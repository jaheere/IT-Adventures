# IT Adventures – Nerdstown Chronicles  
#### Author: Luca Bocaletto  
#### OS: Linux  
#### Genre: Text Adventures

**A comedic, tech-heavy text adventure in pure open-source style**  

In **IT Adventures**, you don the hoodie of Luca, a quick-witted sysadmin with a knack for command-line humor. Your playground is **Nerdstown**, a neon-lit city where Ethernet cables crisscross sidewalks like vines, and cafés brew “Espresso at 5 GHz.” You’ll start in your cluttered hacker den—monitor towers balanced like Jenga blocks, Linux stickers plastering every surface, and a cat furiously tapping on a keyboard—before venturing out to:

- **TechCorp’s open-space**: dodge crashing 500 errors, scavenge discarded hard drives, and face your first fetch quest.  
- The **Bean Overclock Café**: where baristas challenge you with impromptu Linux quizzes while you sip a “Latte 16-Thread.”  
- The **Data Center**: a labyrinth of buzzing server racks where you’ll wield soldering irons and power banks to revive dead disks.  
- Hidden corners like the **Retro Museum**, where you prove your vintage lore with Apple I trivia, and the **Secret AI Lab**, locked behind sudo-only doors.

Along the way you’ll tackle:

  • **Linux quizzes** on commands, file permissions, TCP ports and shell scripts—each correct answer awards XP and reputation.  
  • **Hardware repair missions**: swap bad RAM, solder broken traces, and replace failed power supplies to unlock new areas.  
  • **Fetch quests** to locate rare items (RGB RAM sticks, Raspberry Pi modules, power banks) scattered across Nerdstown.  
  • **Dynamic events**—random DDoS alerts, surprise blackouts, retro‐tech puzzles—that force you to think on your feet and type lightning-fast fixes.  
  • **Eccentric NPCs**: from an RGB-obsessed memory vendor to “Diego The Skid,” a forty-year hacker legend who tests your scp skills.

Every success nets you **XP**, in-game **credits**, open-source **tokens** and coveted **reputation**. Level up to earn `sudo` privileges, open restricted rooms and negotiate high-stakes side-quests. Whether you’re debugging a cron job gone rogue, outsmarting a firewall with clever iptables rules, or simply showing off your grep mastery, **IT Adventures** turns every shell command into a triumph—one witty one-liner at a time.
